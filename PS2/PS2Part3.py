#
# FizzBuzz
#
# Input:
#   n: the maximum integer to iterate up to
#
# Output:
#   For each number from 1 to n (inclusive),
#     print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5,
#     print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3 but not 5,
#     print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 but not 3,
#     print the number itself if it divisible by neither 3 nor 5.
#   Each of these should be printed on a separate line.
#
# Example:
#   >>> fizzbuzz(5)
#   1
#   2
#   Fizz
#   4
#   Buzz
def fizzbuzz(n):
    pass

    print "Running fizzbuzz(5):"
    fizzbuzz(5)
    print "Expected output:"
    print "1\n2\nFizz\n4\nBuzz"
