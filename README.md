CS 196 Spring 2016 | Homework
=========================

Homework for the class will be hosted here, on this website known as [GitHub](http://github.com). It will serve as the central place to get homework throughout the semester, so be sure to bookmark this website or know to come back to it when new problem sets are released!

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system, used by millions of developers around the world to share and collaborate on open-source and private code. It is similar to [subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion), which you also may have used in the past for previous Computer Science classes (but if not, don't fret!).

Projects are organized into `repositories`, or `repos` for short. In each `repo`, there is a new coding project, such as this one which hosts all of the homework assignments for the semester.

For now, don't worry too much about GitHub and what it is - we will get into using GitHub in the near future. Just think of it as a place to host files!

## How do I download the homework?
Go to the `root` of the `homework repo` (most probably, where you are now) ([here](https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Homework-Sp16) if for some reason you arent).

Look to the top-right area of the webpage and find the `Download Zip` button. Click on that and a new zip file will be downloaded with the latest problem sets. That's it!

## How do I submit the homework?
Currently without further knowledge of GitHub, homework submission will be handled via email. In the next couple days, you will receive an email from a CA with the format they want your homework assignments in (most probably, a zip file containing that week's problem set). If you don't receive an email soon, please contact a member of course staff.
