this function takes in three parameters a, b, and c
and returns the solution of x for 0 = a(x^2) + bx + c
print out both solutions to the equation
you can assume the discriminant of the function will be greater than 0
and that it will have two solutions
Hint: How can you represent a square root in the form of a power?
